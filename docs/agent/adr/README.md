# Architecture Decision Records

Every decision affecting two or more files is documented here. Adding,
mutating, or superseding an ADR is itself a code change and ships in the
same atomic commit as the change it justifies.

## How to add an ADR

1. Copy `_template.md` to `NNNN-short-slug.md`, picking the next
   available `NNNN` (zero-padded, monotonic).
2. Fill in frontmatter (`adr_id`, `title`, `status`, `date`).
3. Set status to `accepted` only when implementation lands.
4. Update the index below.
5. Commit ADR + implementation + doc-coverage updates atomically.

## Status legend

- `proposed` — under discussion; do not implement yet.
- `accepted` — current truth; implementation matches.
- `superseded` — replaced; see `superseded_by` frontmatter.
- `deprecated` — wound down without replacement.
